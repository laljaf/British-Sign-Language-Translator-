# British sign language translator for medical emergencies

As many as one in six people are deaf or hard of hearing, however, hospitals, police and most public 
services are not legally required and do not provide qualified sign language interpreters. 
The Sign Language Translator For Public Services (SLTFPS for short), is used, in a context of hospital 
emergency, as an interpreter for sign language: the person requiring assistance is placed in front of a 
camera connected to a computer with the translator program which displays, in text, the translation for 
the signs used by said person. 
This project was developed using concepts such as human action recognition along with resources like 
mediapipe and Tensorflow to train a LSTM model in order to recognise a specific set of signs related to the 
vocabulary of emergencies in a medical context.
